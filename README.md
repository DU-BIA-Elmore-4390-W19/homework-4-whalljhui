## Problem 1 

37 #Conclusive Random Forest with Corresponding MSEs:

74 #Graphical Display:

82 #Model Interpretation:
Through this model, 5 appears to be the best random predictor variable limit for random forests. The display shows 5â€™s corresponding MSE values stay consistently lower relative to other limits. And from the lab, even though higher limits display lower MSEs through cross-validation, it is my intention to avoid overfitting. So after interpreting the model above, and also keeping in mind the cross-validation run, 5 is the ideal mtry.

88 #Fitting the model with the best random predictor variable (5):

104 #Test MSE for 5:
MSE = 5.754378

110 #Understanding variable importance through the best random predictor variable (5):


## Problem 2

149 #Loading Data:

155 #Splitting Training and Validating Set:

165 #Fitting a Regression Tree to the Validation Data:

172 #Summary and Plot

180 #MSE for Tree:
MSE = 4.484515

187 #Cross-validation for Carseats Using Random Forest

199 #Plotted Random Forest CV

206 #Test MSE for Random Forest: mtry = 4
MSE = 3.281054
I chose 4 based on 5's small relative gain in R2, and small relative drop in RMSE to 4. Using mtry = 4 within random forest, compared to the initial tree regression, ends up lowering the test MSE from 4.48 to 3.28.

232 #Variable Importance:

240 #Graphical Representation of Variables via Best rf mtry (4):

263 #Bagging Approach:

271 #Estimating the Bagged MSE:
MSE = 3.040513

283 #Importance of Bagged Variables:

293 #Gradient-boosting Approach:

312 #Graphical Representation of Gradient-boosted Tree (mtry = 6):

318 #MSE for Gradient-boosted Tree:
MSE = 1.776613

332 #Training a Multiple Regression (OLS):

378 #MSE for OLS Model:
MSE = 1.012709

350 #Gradient-boosted Tree vs. OLS Model MSE Results:

The OLS Model actually has a lower MSE than the Gradient-boosted Tree model. This result demonstrates that more simple models should not be discounted in lieu of so many other complex instruments. Context and simple model comparisons must also play a key role in  choice.
